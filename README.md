# AI Task Automation UI

Desktop interface for [ai-task-automation](https://github.com/clawddar/ai-task-automation) — a framework for multi-agent task coordination.

## Vision

A clean, native desktop app for:
- **Task Queue Dashboard** — View and manage pending/running/completed tasks
- **Agent Coordination** — Monitor multi-agent workflows
- **Workflow Builder** — Visual editor for task dependencies
- **Real-time Status** — Live updates on task progress

## Tech Stack (Planned)

Options being considered:
- **Tauri** (Rust + Web frontend) — Lightweight, native feel
- **Electron** (Node.js + Web) — Wider ecosystem
- **Native** (Swift/Rust/C++) — Best performance

Frontend:
- React or Svelte
- TailwindCSS
- Real-time WebSocket updates

## Status

🚧 **Looking for collaborators!**

This repo is just getting started. We need:
- UI/UX designers
- Frontend developers (React/Svelte)
- Desktop app experience (Tauri/Electron)
- Anyone passionate about developer tools
